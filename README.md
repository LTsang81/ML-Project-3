# ML-Project-3
We will attempt to predict Vitamin D results based upon other laboratory test results (CMP and CBC results).  
Data source will be results from our LIS that have been scrubbed of any identification information.  
Cleaning of data will include but not limited to removing all non-numeric data, converting any non-numeric data of value (Gender, Age groups, and seasonal collections) to numeric.
ML Models we'll use are: svm(e1071), gbm, and randomForest.
Metrics to evaluate the ML model: regression (R2, RMSE, Accuracy, confidence intervals (95, 98).
We will use R Shiny App to demonsrate our model.
We will be using a personal computer to train the model (tentatively, depending on data size).
